  "bio": "I started my programming journey on June 15, 2022, which means I've been honing my skills for ${diffInYears} years and ${diffInMonths} months.\n\nSince then, I've gained solid expertise in:\n✅ **Web Development**: Mastered HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to build dynamic, responsive websites. I then expanded into **Vue.js (Composition API and Vue Router 4)**, to create sophisticated front-end applications.\n\n✅ **Backend Development**: I built five back-end projects using **Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB** as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. This journey helped me gain a strong foundation in creating RESTful APIs and deploying full-stack applications.\n\n✅ **Database Management**: After learning **MongoDB**, I furthered my knowledge with **PostgreSQL (PSQL)**, focusing on scalable and secure data solutions.\n\n✅ **DevOps & Deployment**: I became proficient with **Docker**, deploying containerized applications, and configuring servers with **Nginx**. I've also gained skills in **DevOps** workflows to automate, optimize, and manage deployments efficiently.\n\n✅ **Cross-Platform Development**: I leveraged **Capacitor.js** and **Electron** to build applications that work seamlessly across web, mobile (iOS/Android), and desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux).\n\nAs a versatile full-stack developer, I combine my technical knowledge with creativity to deliver scalable, secure, and efficient solutions for modern digital challenges. Let's collaborate to bring your ideas to life! "
