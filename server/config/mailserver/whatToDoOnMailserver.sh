# Configure DKIM, SPF, and DMARC
# you can create dkim config using:

# A: HOST: mta-sts.baderidris.com VALUE: <MAIL-SERVER-IP> TTL auto
# then added the required file and bound it in the copmose file
# and required the certs from certbot for the new subdomain, mta-sts
# then added the file to be sent out in both 443 and 80 ports, check the nginx conf file for prod!

# optionals
# it defaults to be enabled in mailserver.env
docker exec -it mail setup quota set contact@baderidris.com 15G  # limiting the space to 10GB for this user
