# Introduction

This is a portfolio that I got its design from a figma file created by *Yanka Darelova*.

## How to preview it locally

To preview this web application, you should have npm && node installed on your machine!

You can check if they exist or not, by opening a terminal then typing these commands:

```sh
npm -v
# it should show the currently installed version as 10.7.0
node -v
# as v20.15.0
```

then you should go to the subdirectory `client` and run `npm install` then `npm start`

```sh
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
# it'll appear the running url as http://localhost:5173 or +1
# click on that url or open it in your browser
```

With these steps you will be able to preview my portfolio application!

Or you can build the version then run it locally. to get faster results by typing:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
# the terminal will show the url: http://localhost:4173 than you can open to get the preview app
```
